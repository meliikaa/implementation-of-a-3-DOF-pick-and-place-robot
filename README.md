# 3-DOF Pick and Place Robot Implementation

Welcome to the **3-DOF Implementation Pick and Place** repository! This project demonstrates the construction and implementation of a 3-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) pick and place robot. This work is an extension of the original project centered around a 6-DOF robot developed by Kawasaki Company. In this iteration, the focus is on the last three degrees of freedom, which have been reimagined and redesigned using SolidWorks software. The resulting components were then fabricated through 3D printing using PLA filament.

## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to create a capable and efficient 3-DOF pick and place robot. The design decisions made during this process ensure optimal torque for the desired orientations. To achieve this, MG996R servo motors were thoughtfully integrated into the robot's mechanical structure. Additionally, the robot's links were intentionally hollowed out to achieve a lightweight design while adhering to specific limitations.

## Features

- **Mechanical Redesign:** The original 6-DOF robot's final three degrees of freedom have been reengineered using SolidWorks. This ensures precise movement and efficient functionality.
- **Material Utilization:** PLA filament is employed for 3D printing the redesigned components. This choice of material strikes a balance between durability and weight.
- **Torque Management:** MG996R servo motors are integrated strategically to provide the required torque for accurate and controlled motion.
- **Weight Optimization:** Hollowing out the links of the robot reduces its overall weight, contributing to enhanced performance and compliance with constraints.
- **Control System:** The robot's control system is implemented using an Arduino microcontroller. Unlike the previous iteration, direct control is now employed, eliminating the need for the servo motor controller board and Arduino library.
