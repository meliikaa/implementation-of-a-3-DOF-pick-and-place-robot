# 3_dof_implementation_pick_and_place
the last project was done on a 6dof robot from kawasaki company. In this project the last 3 degree of freedome were eliminated, and the rest were redesigned in Solidwork software and were printed with PLA filament.~~
The MG996R were used to provide enough torque to make the necessary orientation possible.~~
The links were also emptied out so the weight would not excced the limitaion.~~
The controller was done on arduino.~~
The controller board of servo motors were taken out so we would be responsible for controlling. Therefore, the library in arduino was not used.~~
